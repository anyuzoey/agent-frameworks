# 🐝 Bee Agent Framework for parasol demo 

The **Bee Framework** provides two ways to develop agents:  

## 1. Low/No Code UI

### Pros
- Easy to use, with side-by-side editing and testing.

### Cons
1. Limited functionality:
   - Cannot call other agents within the same project.
   - Supports custom tools and can call tools in a custom agent.
2. Error messages are not intuitive:
   - Custom tools must include docstrings in the correct position with proper spacing, or they will result in a `400` error.
3. Examples screenshots:

## 2. Developer Version for Advanced Settings  
The developer version provides more advanced customization options for building agents.

This is a customized version of the [Bee Agent Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework), featuring an AI agent (`parasolv5.ts`) that evaluates risk and approval decisions. You can interact with the agent via:

✅ **Command Line Execution**  
✅ **REST API (FastAPI)**  
✅ **Web Interface (Streamlit UI)**

## 🛠️ Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies `npm ci`.
3. Configure your project by filling in missing values in the `.env` file. You can modify based on `.env.template` file. For LLM, I've tested Groq LLM API. 
4. Run the agent 
    4.1 run it via terminal 
    `npm run start src/parasolv3.ts` play with it using terminal
    or
    `npm run start src/parasolv5.ts` which reads from input.json and return output.json
    or
    4.2 run it via a easy UI
    `python server.py` 
    `streamlit rn app.py`
    Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser.
